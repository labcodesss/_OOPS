# _OOPS
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes code into objects, encapsulating data and behavior. It follows key principles: Encapsulation (hiding data), Abstraction (simplifying complexity), Inheritance (reusing code), and Polymorphism (flexible behavior). OOP improves modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
